This is an End 2 End project. That means I have not only trained a model created an pipline to train, evaluate and inference pipline. Used Flast to build a Rest api and deployed it in AWS . Created github actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment. Used MLFlow for model tracking and experiment tracking. Used DVC for pipeline tracking. Created a docker file for container creation. 

inorder to use this project you can clone this repo from [github](https://github.com/Abhisekh97/Sentiment-Analysis)
how to install and run entiner documentation is provided in readme file.
## Future Scope -
- In future I will create more of such projects in NLP and computer vision
